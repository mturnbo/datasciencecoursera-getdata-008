## Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

 - Subject ID (integer)
 - Activity (string)
  	- Walking
  	- Walking Upstairs
  	- Walking Downstairs
  	- Sitting
  	- Standing
  	- Laying

## Means of Activity Measurements

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each activity for each subject. All values are floating point numbers.
